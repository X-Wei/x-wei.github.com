============
 Open Graph
============

This plugin adds Open Graph Protocol tags to your articles.


Usage
=====

To output the tags generated by this plugin, simply add this code in
your template:

.. code-block:: jinja2

    {% for tag in article.ogtags %}
        <meta property="{{tag[0]}}" content="{{tag[1]|striptags|e}}" />
    {% endfor %}

Metadata values are constructed from the SITENAME and SITEURL
settings, from the article title, from the article slug, from the
article category and from these standard metadata tags:

- ``date``
- ``modified``
- ``tags``

Additionaly, the plugin also read these metadata tags:

- ``og_image``, an URL to an image that will represent your article;
- ``og_description``, a short description of your article. If not
  provided, the description will be set to ``summary``, which is often
  too long;
- ``og_locale``, the locale of your article (e.g. 'fr_CA'). If not provided,
  the locale will be set to your Pelican settings ``LOCALE``.
