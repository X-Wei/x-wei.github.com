Well, to be brief...
-----------------
I made a french input method, if you got annoyed by the freaking french keyboard when typing accented words (i.e.  **é, û, ü, î,...** ), or you are using a QWERTY keyboard, this will be quite useful !

In fact, I used [XiaoxiaoInput](http://yong.dgod.net/) and [Fcitx](https://fcitx-im.org/wiki/Fcitx), which are 2 excellent Chinese input methods, I just made a french word table, and added it to the program...

- unzip the file
- if you are using 32-bit system, cilck the  ``/yong.exe, `` if you in 64-bit system, click  ``/w64/yong.exe`` 
- you can see a round french flag icon in the right-bottom corner

- click the icon, or press `ctrl+space`, you can see the icon become brighter, which means the input method is active 
- in the meantime, you can also see a small panel appear in the right-bottom corner with a french flag at left:

- you can type french with the input method now,  **enjoy** !
- choose the words by pressing the corresponding `number button`, or press `space` key to choose the first candidate
- sometimes there are >9 candidates, to see more candidates, use `-/=` to flip pages forward and backward
- if you want to input what you type instead of the candidates in the list, just press `Enter` button
- if you want to change to normal keyboard, you can press `LeftShift`, and you can see that the icon in the panel become a icon of a keyboard:

- or you can just press `ctrl+space`, to disable the input method (then the round flag icon become dark again, indicating it's not active)
- or you can right-click the round flag icon to totaly exit the program:
